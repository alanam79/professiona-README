# Professional READme

# Purpose
To create an easy questionnaire to allow someone to quickly and effectively generate a professional READme.md

* The user will be given a command-line application that accepts user input
* The user is presented with prompts to generate the README.md such as title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
* The user is able to choose a license for the application
* If a license is selected, an image of the license is displayed at the top of the README.md
* When a user enters their GitHub profile, a link is displayed
* When a user enters their email, it is displayed on the profile with instructions on how to reach the creator
* When links in the Table of Contents are clicked, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README.md
